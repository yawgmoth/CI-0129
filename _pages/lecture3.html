# Representation

# Graphs

  * A graph G = (V,E) consists of *vertices* (nodes) V and *edges* (connections) `\( E \subseteq V \times V \)`
  
  * Graphs can be connected, or have multiple components
  
  * Graphs can be directed (one-way streets) or undirected 
  
  * Edges can have weights (costs) associated with them: `\( w: E \mapsto \mathbb{R} \)`
  
  * We can represent many things in graphs
  
---

# Graphs

  * We can "walk" around our graph 
  
  * Say we start at some node, and follow an edge 
  
  * If we can get back to our start node without visiting any edge twice we have found a "cycle"
  
  * Cycles can complicate some things, so we like graphs without them 
  
  * These graphs are called "trees"
  
---

# Trees

  * An alternative view: We take some node and call it the *root*
  
  * All nodes connected to the root are its *children*, which we put in another layer
  
  * We then add another layer with the children's children, etc. 
  
  * In the end, we have the root at the top, with a number of layers below it

# A note on Trees 

* Our choice of "root" was completely arbitrary in this case 

* We can redraw the same tree with a different node as the root 

* For many applications in AI we have some *interpretation* of the nodes, though 

* For example: In Single-player games the root is the current game state, and each edge is an action the player could perform

# Tree Search 

* Let's say we want to win this game

* We start at the root node and then we *search* for a *path* that leads to a solution state 

* What strategies/algorithms could we use to perform this search?

# Uninformed Search

  - The simplest pathfinding algorithm(s) works like this:
  
      - Keep track of which nodes are candidates for expansion (starting with the start node)
      - Take one of these nodes and expand it 
      - If you reach the target, you have found a path
      
  - How do you "keep track" of nodes?
  
      - Use a list/queue: You now have "breadth-first search"
      - Use a stack: You now have "depth-first search"

# Graph Search

---

# Graph Search 

* Instead of a tree, many problems are actually better represented as a (general) graph 

* That means we may have loops 

* During the search process we need to avoid "running in circles"

* Other than that, we can use the same approach!

---

# The (undirected) Pathfinding problem

Given a graph G = (V,E), with edge weights w, a start node `\( s \in V \)`, a destination node `\( d \in V \)`, find a sequence of vertices `\( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n  \)`, such that `\(v_1 = s, v_n = d \)` and `\( \forall i: (v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E \)`

We call the sequence `\( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \)` a *path*, and the *cost* of the path is `\( \sum_i w((v_i,v_{i+1})) \)`

--

This means what you would expect: To find a path from a start node to a destination node means to find vertices to walk through that lead from the start to the 
destination by being connected with edges. The cost is the sum of the costs of edges that need to be traversed.

# Uninformed Search

  - The simplest pathfinding algorithm(s) works like this:
  
      - .red[Keep track of which nodes have already been expanded]
      - Keep track of which nodes are candidates for expansion (starting with the start node)
      - Take one of these nodes and expand it .red[(avoid revisiting expanded nodes)]
      - If you reach the target, you have found a path
      
  - How do you "keep track" of nodes?
  
      - Use a list/queue: You now have "breadth-first search"
      - Use a stack: You now have "depth-first search"

# Depth-First Search

  * Save the "frontier" as a stack, initialized with the starting node 
  
  * If the goal is in the frontier, we are done
  
  * Else, for each node in the frontier, add all of its neighbors that have not yet been expanded to the frontier 
  
  * Repeat
  
  * Basically: Add all neighbors, then add the first neighbor's neighbors, then add the first neighbor's first neighbor's neighbors, etc.

---

class: small

# Limitations

  * Depth-First Search can lead to some very long paths 
  
  * If we have an infinite graph, Depth-First Search will probably even fail completely
  
  * Breadth-First Search may need a lot of memory to remember the frontier and paths to get there 
  
  * Both of them ignore costs
  
---

class: small

# Some improvements

  * We can limit the depth that Depth-First Search should explore
  
     - Now it will "work" on infinite graphs 
     - We may also avoid some of the long paths
  
  * Idea: start with a depth limit of 1, run Depth-First Search, and if it can't find a path, increase the depth limit
  
  * This is called "Iterative Deepening"
  
  * To account for costs, we can use the cost as the order for Depth-First Search, and only make Breadth-First Search expand the node it can reach with the lowest cost in each iteration

# More Graphs
  
---

class: small

# Another Application

  * Graphs are a very flexible way to represent problems!
  
  * Take, for example, Super Mario
  
  * Each action Mario performs will generate a "new" game state, and we can search for a way to beat a level this way!
  
<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/marioas.png" width="50%"/>

---

# Search Graphs

  * What if we have infinite (or at least very large) graphs?
  
  * We can't really store the entire graph in memory 
  
  * But do we need to?
  
---

# Lazy Evaluation

  * Some programming languages (like Haskell) use something called *lazy evaluation*
  
  * This means a value is only evaluated when it is needed 
  
  * For example `[1..]` is an infinite list of integers in Haskell 
  
  * But as long as you don't try to access *all* elements, it does not need to generate them 
  
  * We can "simulate" this behavior in other languages using functions
  
---

# Lazy Evaluation for Graphs 

  * Instead of representing an entire graph in memory, let's say we just store one node 
  
  * Each node can, when requested, give us its neighbors
  
  * We can then even "forget" the original node, if we want to
  
  * The only requirement is that each node only has finitely many neighbors (and preferably not too many)
  
---

# An Infinite Graph

* Let's say we have a graph with one node for each integer 

* Each node has 2 to 4 neighbors: The predecessor and successor, twice its value, and half its value (if it is even). All distances are 1

* "1" has the neighbors "0" and "2"

* "3" has the neighbors "2", "4", and "6"

* "4" has the neighbors "3", "5", "8", and "2"

* "16" has the neighbors "15", "17", "32", and "8"

---

# Goal Conditions

* We often also don't want to look for one specific (of our infinitely many) nodes, but rather a node that satisfies some condition

* For example, what if we want a node that is greater than 1000 and a power of 2? 

* Each of the nodes "1024", "2048", "4096", etc. would be a valid solution 

* How could we find a path starting from "127" to find such a goal node?

---

class: medium

# Why are we doing this?

* (Almost) anything can be described as a graph

* As long as we have a representation of a "node", a way to get "neighbors", a predicate that tells us what is a "goal", we can use our search algorithms

* Nodes can be anything: locations, game states, sentences, etc.

* Edges connect nodes: roads, game actions, adding/removing words, etc.

# Lab 1
  
---

class: medium

# For the Lab

* In Lab 1 you will implement Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Greedy Search and A* (we will cover the last two next time) for arbitrary graphs

* You will get a python "framework" that contains some example graphs you can test your algorithms on

* You should also come up with at least one graph of your own (a map of your home town, campus, your favorite video game, ...)

* You will have the class hours of 23/3 and 30/3 in the lab, where I will be able to directly assist you 

* You should be able to finish in these 6 hours, but the submission deadline is on Friday, 3/4, AoE

---

# For the Lab 

* The framework contains a definition of a graph that makes use of a lazy evaluation scheme

```python
class Node:
    def get_neighbors(self):
        # returns a list of edges to neighbors
        return []
        
        
# Each edge contains the target node, the cost of taking 
# that path and a name 
class Edge:
    def __init__(self, target, cost, name):
        self.target = target 
        self.cost = cost
        self.name = name
```

---

# For the Lab

* Take a look at `graph.py` to see how these classes are used to set up a finite graph (of Austria), as well as an infinite graph (the integer graph we discussed earlier).

* You do not have to change anything in `graph.py`, but you are encouraged to come up with more examples to test your implementation 

---

class: medium

# For the Lab 

The actual task is to complete `search.py` by implementing `bfs`, `dfs`, `greedy` and `astar`:

```python
def bfs(start, goal):
    # returns: 
    #    path (list of edges) or None if no path found
    return []
```

Note that the goal is a function!

```python
def atgoal(n):
    return n.get_id() == target
```
