# Logic

---

# Why Logic?

  * Remember: Everything in AI is either representation or search 
  
  * Logical formulas are often a very convenient representation
  
  * Why convenient?
     
      - Can be generated automatically
      - Can be processed automatically 
      - Are very expressive

  * Logic is used extensively in AI!
  
---

# Propositional Logic 
  
  * `\(a \wedge b\)`: a **and** b
  
  * `\(a \vee b\)`: a **or** b (or both!)

  *  `\(\neg a\)`: **not** a 
  
  * `\(a \rightarrow b\)`: a **implies** b, which means: if `a` is true, `b` also has to be true (but if `a` is false, `b` can be true or false). Logically equivalent to `\(\neg a \vee b\)`
  
  * When you see **iff** (or in Spanish "sii", "ssi" or "syss") in text it is not a typo, it means "if and only if", a bidirectional implication ("a iff b" means that if `a` is true `b` is true, but if `a` is false, `b` is also false)
  
---

# Propositional Logic 

  * How do we tell if a formula is true?
  
  * We need to know if a and b (and all other constants) are "true"
  
  * In other words, if we have some "interpretation" `W` of `a` and `b`, we can determine truth values
  
  * `\( W \models  a \wedge b \)` iff `a` and `b` are both true in `W`, i.e. `\( W \models a \)` **and** `\(W \models b \)`
  
  * So what is W?
  
---

class: medium

# Interpretations

  * W is an *interpretation* (also called *state* or *world*), which assigns truth values to every constant

  * Sometimes it is convenient to just represent W as a set that contains everything that is true 
  
  * Conversely, everything that is not in the set is false ("closed world assumption")
  
  * A *model* is an interpretation under which a formula is satisfied 
  
  * We say W *models* a formula, if the formula is satisfied under that interpretation
  
  * A formula is a tautology if *all* interpretations are models
  
---

# Interpretations

$$
W = \\{a, b, c\\}
$$

$$
W \models a \wedge b \\\\
W \models a \vee d \\\\
W \not\models a \wedge d\\\\
W \models d \rightarrow a\\\\
\ldots
$$

# Predicate Logic

---

# Predicate Logic 

  * Representing any non-trivial state in propositional logic is tedious (imagine chess: there has to be one variable for each possible location of each piece)
  
  * *Predicate Logic*, on the other hand, represents the world as objects and relations between them 
  
  * Objects: constants
  
  * Relations: Sets of n-tuples of objects, called predicates (n is the *arity* of the predicate)
  
  * (Functors: Assignments of n-tuples of objects to objects)
  
  * We also have quantifiers `\( \forall, \exists \)`
  
---

# Predicate Logic: Example

$$
\mathit{human}(\mathit{socrates})\\\\
\forall h: \mathit{human}(h) \rightarrow \mathit{mortal}(h)\\\\
\mathit{friends}(\mathit{socrates}, \mathit{plato})
$$
--
`\(\mathit{human}(h)\)` is an unary relation, i.e. a set of 1-tuples/single elements. It is often more convenient to write:

$$
\forall h \in \mathit{human}: \mathit{mortal}(h)
$$
--
Using set-operators, we could also write `\((\mathit{socrates}, \mathit{plato}) \in \mathit{friends}\)`

In fact, as we will see, that's how our interpretations work.

---

# Predicate Logic: Syntax

  * A predicate name with parameters is called an *Atom* or *atomic formula*, e.g. `\(\mathit{human}(h)\)`
  
  * A *literal* is an atom of the negation of an atom, e.g. `\(\neg \mathit{human}(h)\)`
  
  * The `h` can either be a constant or a variable 
  
  * If `h` is part of our *domain*, it is a constant 
  
  * If `h` does not refer to any concrete object, it is a variable. A variable can be *bound* by a quantifier, or it can be *unbound*/*free*
  
  * A formula with no free variables is called *ground*
  
---

# Predicate Logic: Syntax

  * Given two predicate logic formulas `\(\phi\)` and `\(\psi\)`, we can use the usual logical connectives `\(\wedge, \vee, \rightarrow, \neg \)` to construct more complex formulas 

  * Conceptually, this will result in a (syntax) tree, where each interior node is an operator, and the leaves are atoms
  
  * If we have a formula `\(\phi\)` that contains a free variable `x`, we can *substitute* that variable with a value t, written `\(\phi[t/x]\)`
  
---

# Predicate Logic: Semantics

  * Given a (ground) formula `\(\phi\)` and an interpretation/world `\(W\)`, we want to know if the formula holds in that world, i.e. if the world is a model for the formula
  
  * We write this as `\(W \models \phi\)` ("W models phi")
  
  * How do we determine that? 
  
     - If `\(\phi\)` is an atom, it is true iff `\(\phi \in W\)`
     - If `\(\phi\)` is a more complex formula, use the syntax tree to determine the truth value
     
---

# Predicate Logic: Semantics

$$
W \models \neg \phi \:\:\text{iff}\:\:W \not\models \phi\\\\
W \models \phi \wedge \psi\:\:\text{iff}\:\:W \models \phi\:\:\text{and}\:\:W \models \psi\\\\
W \models \phi \vee \psi\:\:\text{iff}\:\:W \models \phi\:\:\text{or}\:\:W \models \psi\\\\
W \models \phi \rightarrow \psi\:\:\text{iff}\:\:W \not\models \phi\:\:\text{or}\:\:W \models \psi\\\\
W \models \forall x \in X: \phi\:\:\text{iff}\:\:W \models \phi[t/x]\:\:\text{for all}\:t \in X\\\\
W \models \exists x \in X: \phi\:\:\text{iff}\:\:W \models \phi[t/x]\:\:\text{for any}\:t \in X
$$

# Predicate Logic: Interpretations 

  * We start with a *domain*, the set of all objects we can talk about

  * Technically, an interpretation has to assign objects to all our constants, since Socrates and Plato could be the same person in an interpretation! We 
  will use the *unique-names assumption* to avoid such problems and will just assume that the constants are the same as the objects.
  
  * Then, the interpretation has to contain definitions for every predicate, in the form of a set of tuples.
  
  * The *closed world assumption* states that everything we don't know to be true (i.e. everything not in the set representing a predicate) is in fact false.
  
  * Using these assumptions, we can represent our interpretation as a set of true atoms, or as a collection of sets, one for each predicate.

# Data Structures

# Data Structures 

  * If we actually want to use logic for something, we need an implementation 
  
  * We will start with how to store formulas and interpretations in data structures 
  
  * This will provide us with a way to query the truth-values of logical formulas under an interpretation 
  
  * Later we will see how we can manipulate these interpretations

---

class: small

# Data Structures 

  * First we need to represent atoms, maybe just as tuples: `\(human(h)\)` becomes `("human", "h")` or `("human", ("h",))`
  
  * Then we can store the atoms in a suitable data structure, e.g. a python set, to get our world 
  
  * We represent our syntax tree using a data structure, e.g. 
  
```
class LogicalFormula:
    def isModeledBy(self, world):
        return False
```
  
  * We subclass this for each syntactic element, overriding `isModeledBy` accordingly
  
  * For example, the subclass `Atom`, will do `return self.atom in world.atoms` (and store `self.atom` appropriately)
  
  * The subclass `And` needs to call `isModeledBy` for all its children, and return `True` iff all of them return `True` 
  
---

# Data Structure: And 

```
class And(LogicalFormula):
    def __init__(self, children):
        self.children = children
    
    def isModeledBy(self, world):
    
        result = True 
        for c in self.children:
            result = result and c.isModeledBy(world)
            
        return result
```

Note: This and can have more than two children, which is a useful optimization! 
  
---

class: small

# Data Structures 
  
  * For the quantifiers `\(\forall\)` and `\(\exists\)` we need to be able to substitute variables in formulas, so we need to add another method to our base class:
  
```
def substitute(self, variable, value):
    return self
```

  * This method should replace the given variable with the given value in *all* children, or parameters (in the case of atoms), and returns a **copy** of itself with the substitution performed
  
  * `Forall` can then use this in its `isModeledBy` method
  
```
def isModeledBy(self, world):
    values = world.getValues(self.variable)
    for value in values:
        if not isModeledBy(self.child.substitute(self.variable, value): return False 
    return True
```

---

# Data Structures 

  * Now we can represent logical interpretations and formulas 
  
  * We can use this to determine which formulas hold under our interpretation 
  
  * An agent could, for example, use this to collect some true data and then reason about which rules hold (e.g. collect information about all animals and items in a zoo, and then determine if every animal has something to eat)
  
  * The other direction is even more interesting, though: Collect *some* information and have the rules, and "generate" more information

---

class: center, middle

# Inference

---

# Inference 

* Just having a static interpretation of the world is not very interesting 

* One form of intelligence could be to generate/derive "new" knowledge 

* Or answer questions 

* This process is called *inference*

---

# Inference 

* Facts: What we know about the world, which includes literals and formulas 

* Rules: Logical instructions that tell us how we can generate more facts, using properties of logic

* You can also imagine this as a logical proof: We know some things about the world, and we prove that some other things logically follow

---

class: mediumt

# Modus Ponens

Maybe the most "famous" inference rule is the Modus Ponens:

$$
\{a, a \rightarrow b\} \models b 
$$

If we know `a` and we know that `a` implies `b`, then we can conclude `b`

Note how the notation is a generalization of what we used for interpretations: Any set can be on the left side!

---

class: medium

# Queries

* With this, an agent can start generating facts that exist and fill a database

* A user can then ask a "question" in the form of a query: Is x true?

* If the agent has the asked fact in their database they answer with yes

* By keeping track of the used rules, the agent can also provide a proof!

---

# Inference Algorithms

* In practice, we may have "many" possible facts 

* Imagine a logical reasoning system for natural numbers: We can say a number is prime if it has some properties (number of proper divisors is equal to two), but we don't want the agent to generate **all** prime numbers 

* Instead we can answer queries: Does a particular formula hold, e.g. "Is 9 a prime number"?

* There are several different algorithms to answer such queries

---

# Resolution

* Resolution is one such algorithm to perform inference

* The idea is to take disjunctions ("or"s) of logical literals as rules

* If we know that one of this literals is false, we can infer that at least one of the others must be true

* Also remember that an implication is also an or!

$$
a \rightarrow b \Leftrightarrow \neg a \vee b\\\\
\{\neg a \vee b, a\} \models b
$$

How to do queries: We negate the query and try to "resolve" it with what we know

$$
\{\neg a \vee b, a, \neg b\} \models \bot
$$

---

class: mediumt

# Prolog

Prolog is a logical programming language that allows us to write such disjunctions and then does the inference by resolution for us!

```Prolog
a.
b :- a.
c :- not(b).

?- b 
true

?- c
false
```

Unfortunately we don't have time to go into detail :(

# Actions

---

# Actions? 

  * We often want to represent a world that is changing, rather than just static facts 
  
  * Simple solution: Let's use constants representing (discrete) times, and increase the arity of each predicate by one to account for time 
  
  * For example, `\(\mathit{human}(\mathit{socrates})\)` becomes `\(\mathit{human}(\mathit{socrates}, 0)\)`, or 
  `\(\forall t \in T: \mathit{human}(\mathit{socrates}, t)\)`
  
  * An *action* is something that changes some truth values over time, often represented as an implication, like `\(\mathit{alive}(\mathit{socrates}, 400 \text{BCE}) \rightarrow \neg \mathit{alive}(\mathit{socrates}, 399 \text{BCE})\)`
  
  * This can be generalized with quantifiers and special predicates that indicate when actions occur, if needed

---

# The Yale Shooting Problem 

   * Consider Fred, a turkey, and a gun 
   
   * At time 0, Fred is alive and the gun is unloaded
   
   * We load the gun, so that at time 1 the gun is loaded 
   
   * Then we wait 
   
   * At time 2 we shoot, such that at time 3 Fred is dead 
   
---

# The Yale Shooting Problem 

$$
\mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred}, 0)\\\\
\neg \mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun}, 0)\\\\
\neg \mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun}, 0) \rightarrow \mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun}, 1)\\\\
\mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun}, 2) \rightarrow \neg \mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred}, 3)
$$

--

What about `\(\mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred}, 1)\)`?

What about `\(\mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun}, 2)\)`?

Idea: Let's say "the least" number of things change each time step!

--

The turkey could still die at time step 1 and stay dead ...

---

# The Frame Problem 

  - The Yale Shooting Problem is an illustration of the Frame Problem: Everything that is not changed by an action (the "frame") should stay the same 
  
  - But how would we even write this in logical formulas?
  
  - There are several solutions!
  
  - One approach: Frame axioms. For each action state what the action leaves unchanged. This may require a lot of extra formulas.
  
  - Another approach: Distinguish states and actions, and represent changes as a transition system 
  
---

class: center, middle 

# Transition Systems
  
---

# Transition System Approach 

  - We start with an initial state `\(s_0 = \{\mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred}), \neg \mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun}) \}\)` (or, using the closed-world assumption simply `\(s_0 = \{\mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred})\}\)`), which we can use for logical queries such as
  `\(s_0 \models \mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred}) \)`
  
  - We have an action `load(Gun)` which turns a state into another state:
  
     - If the Gun is not loaded, it becomes loaded 
     - If the Gun is already loaded, nothing happens 
     
  - `\(s_1 = \{\mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred}), \mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun}) \}\)`
  
  - Now we can query `\(s_1 \models \mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred})\)`
  
---

# Transition System Approach

  - This forms the basis for the planning problem, which we will discuss for the rest of the semester
  
  - We can express many interesting problems this way, such as how to distribute packages using trucks and airplanes, determine a robot's actions to perform a task, play games, etc.
  
  - However, it also has drawbacks: If our states only represent individual time steps, we can't (easily) query things like "how long was Fred alive"
  
  - As another part of task 1 you will implement a way to apply actions to worlds/states
  
---

# What is an action?

  * We consider our actions to consist of two parts: a precondition and an effect
  
  * The precondition tells us when we can use an action (e.g. we can only shoot if we even have the gun)
  
  * The effect tells us what happens (if the gun is loaded, we kill the turkey, otherwise nothing happens)
  
  * We can determine if a precondition holds in a world with our `models` function 
  
  * We also need to be able to apply an effect, which is where `apply` comes in 
  
---

class: medium

# What is an effect 

  * For simplicity, we will assume our effects are also represented as a logical formula, which tells us what is true after the action 
  
  * However, we will only support a subset of formulas as possible effects 
  
  * For example, what would a formula like `\(a \vee b\)` mean as an effect?
  
--

  * We'll call the subset of formulas we allow the *effect formulas*
  
  * An effect formula can be a conjunction of:
     - Literals (atoms and negated atoms)
     - Forall-quantifiers where the inner formula is also an effect formula
     - `when` expressions
	 
---

# Effect Application

   * Since an effect is just a formula, we could add a method to our base class:
   
```
def apply(self, world):
    return world
```

   * Depending on the formula, we can then override this method and apply the changes of the subformulas
   
   * This may be tricky to get right (particularly negated literals), I'll show you another way later
   
   * For `And` you can do something like:

```
def apply(self, world):
    result = world 
	for c in self.children:
	    result = c.apply(result)
    return result
```

---

# When-Expressions 

  * Some actions have different effects, depending on what is already true in the world, like firing the gun which as a different effect when the gun is loaded 
  
  * We could make two actions: `fire-gun-if-loaded` and `fire-gun-if-not-loaded`, but this becomes cumbersome to write 
  
  * Instead we allow conditional effects that are only applied when a condition holds:
  
$$
\operatorname{when}\:(\phi)\:(\psi)
$$

  * Note that the condition can be *any* logical formula, but the conditional effect has to be an effect formula
  
---

# When-Expressions Example

Say we have the worlds 

$$
s_0 = \\{\mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred})\\}\\\\
s_1 = \\{ \mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred}), \mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun}) \\}
$$

And the effect of the shoot action:

$$
e = \operatorname{when}\:(\mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun}))\:(\neg \mathit{alive}(\mathit{Fred}) \wedge \neg \mathit{loaded}(\mathit{Gun})
$$

What happens when we apply e to `\(s_0\)`?<br/>
What happens when we apply it to `\(s_1\)`?
  
---

# When-Expressions, Implementation

  * We can represent a when-expression as a tuple in the Abstract Syntax Tree `("when", x, y)`, where x is the condition and y is the conditional effect
  
  * Just like with the logical connectives, we introduce a subclass of `LogicalFormula` that represents a when-expression
  
  * When we apply the when-expression to a world, we apply the y-part iff the x-part holds, e.g.
  
```
class When(LogicalFormula):
   def apply(self, world):
       if self.condition.isModeledBy(world):
           return self.effect.apply(world)
       return world
```
  
---

class: medium

# Implementing Action Application

  * There are several ways to implement action application
  
  * One is with the `apply` method in all `LogicalFormula` subclasses 
  
  * Another is to determine the additions and deletions a formula causes and use set operations on the set of atoms 
  
```
class LogicalFormula:
   def getChanges(self, world):
       return (self.getAdditions(world),self.getDeletions(world))
```
  
  * The latter is probably (depending on the exact implementation, and the rest of the code) slightly faster, because it makes fewer copies of the atom set, and you could precompute a lot (minus conditional expressions)
