# Artificial Intelligence

### PDDL

# Planning

---

# Reminder: The Planning Problem 

A planning problem consists of three parts:

  * A definition of the current state of the world
  
  * A definition of a desired state of the world
  
  * A definition of the actions the agent can take
  
All of these definitions are done in "some" formal language.

---

class: medium

# The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)

  * In The Olden Days every planner used their own input format
  
  * The formats not only differed in syntax, but also in capabilities
  
  * In 1998 Drew McDermott and colleagues developed a standardized language for planning problems: PDDL
  
  * This made comparisons between different planners easier and lead to the creating of the International Planning Competition
  
---

class: medium

# PDDL Influences

  * STRIPS, represented operators as preconditions, additions and deletions
  
  * Other languages, such as ADL, supported a wider variety of formulas as preconditions and effects

  * The idea of actions having "preconditions", that describe when they are applicable, and "effects" that describe what is changed, was common to many of them
  
  * The "core" of PDDL is therefore the definition of actions
  
---

class: medium

# PDDL Layout

  * PDDL separates a planning problem into two files
  
     - The domain, which defines how the actions operate
     - The problem, which defines the initial state and the goal
  
  * The idea is that the domain can be reused for many different problems
  
  * Since historically many planners were written in LISP, PDDL uses the same basic syntax: S-Expressions
  
---

# S-Expressions

 * Simply put, an S-Expression consists of parenthesized list, where each element can be either a literal string or another S-Expression
 
 * (Classically S-Expressions are defined as having two elements, which are concatenated with a period `.`, but this is not commonly explicitly used anymore)
 
 * For example, these are all valid S-Expression:

```Lisp
()
(and (or (not a) b (and (not x) c d e) e))
(defun fib (n) (if (lt n 2) 1 (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
```

---

# S-Expressions

  * Why are S-Expressions useful?
  
  * They are very simple to parse, and we can use them to represent syntax trees
  
  * Remember when we discussed how one would implement logic? We can basically take S-Expressions and directly use them with these data structures

* For each part we have to do some processing

# Extensions: "Requirements"

* PDDL is a standard, but it allows for several extensions

* The planner you use in lab 3 supports

   - `:strips`
   - `:typing`
   - `:adl`, which is an abbreviation for `:disjunctive-preconditions`, `:equality`, `:existential-preconditions`, `:universal-preconditions`, and
     `:conditional-effects`

* There are many other extensions, related to numbers, temporal planning, probabilistic effects, etc.

---

# Types

* Objects and variables in PDDL can have types

* Types form a hierarchy, with a root type containing *all* objects

* We need to store these types so we can expand variables in e.g. forall expressions

---

# Types

* Types are written *after* objects

* A type can be applied to multiple objects at the same time

```
p3 p6 - going_up
p5 p3 p6 p2 p9 p1 - attendant
p7 - never_alone
p2 p7 - conflict_A
p0 p9 p3 p6 p1 p8 p5 p4 - conflict_B
f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9
f10 f11 f12 f13 f14 f15 f16 f17 f18 f19 - floor
```

---

# Type Hierarchy

* Similar to giving types to objects, types can also be "applied" to other types

* This is used to create a type hierarchy, by saying "everything that has type X or Y also has type Z" by writing `X Y - Z`

```
passenger - object
going_up going_down vip
going_nonstop attendant never_alone
conflict_A conflict_B - passenger
floor - object

```

---

# Actions

* "Actions" in PDDL are actually *operators*

* That means they contain free variables, or **parameters** (often with types)

* Each operator may represent multiple actions

* Additionally, each operator contains a precondition and an effect

---

# Action Example

```Lisp
(:action up
  :parameters (?f1 - floor
               ?f2 - floor)
  :precondition (and (lift-at ?f1)
                     (above ?f1 ?f2))
  :effect (and (lift-at ?f2)
               (not (lift-at ?f1)))
)
```

# Planners 

---

class: small

# Running a Planner

* Most planners will provide you with some executable that expects two parameters: a domain file, and a problem file

* Some will then perform some preprocessing step and translate the problem into some internal representation, and you may have to run a second executable on that

* Then you wait ...

--

* And wait ...

--

* And wait ...

--

* And then you get a solution (or not)!

---

# Some Planners

* [FastForward](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff.html)

* [FastDownward](http://www.fast-downward.org/)

* [Glaive](http://nil.cs.uno.edu/projects/glaive/)

---

# Plans

* So you run a planner and it finishes

* The output will be a "plan"

* However, unlike for the input, there is no real standard for the output

* Some/most planners will print the required actions in a PDDL/LISP-like syntax

---

# planning.domains

* Since planning is a very active field of research, there are many planning domains out there

* [planning.domains](http://planning.domains) contains a collection of known domains, drawing from planning competitions and other sources

* All of the files in that repository are PDDL files

* However, they may require various extensions

---

class: center, middle 

# Lab 3

---

# Lab 3

* In Lab 3 you will get a simple (educational) planner written in python

* It parses a domain and a problem file and then performs A* to find a plan

* The heuristic it uses is a very simple one, vaguely based on FastForward

* Don't expect it to win any performance awards

---

class: medium

# Lab 3

* The planner comes with the elevator domain (and some others, you can also look at other domains from [planning.domains](http://planning.domains) if you want)

* The task is to modify the domain to include **two or more** elevators

* You will need an additional type ("elevators"), and additional constants

* Then you have to change the actions so that they include an elevator parameter 

* When you set up a problem, you may observe that the planner only uses one of the elevators

---

class: medium

# Lab 3

For the final part of the lab, add restrictions to your elevators:

  - One elevator can only stop at even floors (0 is even for our purposes)
  
  - One elevator can only stop at odd floors 
  
  - One elevator can only stop at floors divisible by 3
  
Come up with at least one more problem, with at least 8 floors and 5 customers
