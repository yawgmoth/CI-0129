## Introduction

Classes 3 and 4, which are about path finding, will be held in virtual form. This page guides you through the lecture, which consists of short videos, and some text containing tasks
for you to think about and/or discuss with other students. The idea is that you work through this page during normal class hours, and use the available online-channels, including the video conference call and slack, or 
any other medium that you find useful (like Skype, or WhatsApp) to communicate with your classmates and the instructor. However, you also have the option to work through the class content at another time, and send questions 
via email. Please indicate which section your question is about, to make it easier for me to respond effectively.
This page contains all materials for classes 3 **and** 4, because they form one logical unit. For each section, I will also indicate how long it should take you to work through it. The class is designed to be
held as two separate 2 hour lectures, as indicated below. The videos will use the slides for [lecture 3](/CI-0129/slides/lecture3.html) and [lecture 4](/CI-0129/slides/lecture4.html) from the website. 

## Trees ( + 5 minutes discussion)

First, watch this video: 

Think about, or discuss with a class mate, how you would perform a search in this game tree, starting with the root node, until you have found a solution. Think about it from an algorithmic perspective, 
and how you write code to solve the problem.

## Tree Search ( + discussion)

Continue with this video:

Assuming the nodes are ordered from left to right, how many nodes would you visit (add to the frontier) and expand (add all of its children to the frontier) when you search for a path from the root (1) 
to the node labeled 7, with Breadth-First Search? How about Depth-First Search?

<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; border: 1px solid #3bbfe7;" class="codebox">
<dt style="height:22px; text-align: center;"><strong>Answer:</strong>
<input type="button" value="Show" style="width:78px; font-size:10px; margin:0px; padding:0px;" onclick="var spoiler = $(this).parents('.codebox').find('.content').toggle('slow');
if ( this.value == 'Hide' ) { this.value = 'Show'; } else { this.value = 'Hide'; };
return false;"></dt>
<dd><div class="content" name="spoiler" style="display: none;">
  Holaaaaa, Bienvenido!!!!!
</div></dd></div>
